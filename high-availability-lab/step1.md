ScyllaDB offers high availability by replicating data across multiple nodes. The Replication Factor (RF) is equivalent to the number of nodes where data (rows and partitions) are replicated. Data is replicated to multiple (RF=N) nodes.

An RF of ONE means there is only one copy of a row in a cluster, and there is no way to recover the data if the node is compromised or goes down. RF=2 means that there are two copies of a row in a cluster. An RF of at least three is used in most systems.

Data is always replicated automatically. Read or write operations can occur to data stored on any of the replicated nodes.
The Consistency Level (CL) determines how many replicas in a cluster must acknowledge a read or write operation before it is considered successful.

In this part, you’ll bring up a three-node cluster.



## Create a Three-Node Cluster, CQLSH

Before starting the cluster, increase the aio-max-nr value. 

This parameter determines the maximum number of allowable Asynchronous non-blocking I/O (AIO) concurrent requests by the Linux Kernel and it helps ScyllaDB perform in a heavy I/O workload environment.

`echo "fs.aio-max-nr = 1048576" >> /etc/sysctl.conf`{{execute}}


`sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf`{{execute}}

First, you'll bring up a three-node ScyllaDB cluster using Docker. Start with one node, called Node_X:

`docker run --name Node_X -d scylladb/scylla:5.2.0 --overprovisioned 1 --smp 1`{{execute}}

You can learn more about best practices for running ScyllaDB on Docker [here](https://docs.scylladb.com/operating-scylla/procedures/tips/best_practices_scylla_on_docker/).
 
Create two more nodes, Node_Y and Node_Z, and add them to the cluster of Node_X.

The command “$(docker inspect –format='{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}’ Node_X)” translates to the IP address of Node-X: 
 
` docker run --name Node_Y -d scylladb/scylla:5.2.0 --overprovisioned 1 --smp 1 --seeds="$(docker inspect --format='{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' Node_X)"`{{execute}} 
 
 
`docker run --name Node_Z -d scylladb/scylla:5.2.0 --overprovisioned 1 --smp 1 --seeds="$(docker inspect --format='{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' Node_X)"`{{execute}} 

Wait a minute or so and check the node status: 

`docker exec -it Node_X nodetool status`{{execute}}  

You’ll see that, eventually, all the nodes have UN for status. U means up, and N means normal. If you get a message "nodetool: Unable to connect to ScyllaDB API server: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused (Connection refused)", it means you have to wait a bit more for the node to be up and responding. 

You can read more about Nodetool Status [here](https://docs.scylladb.com/operating-scylla/nodetool-commands/status/).

Once the nodes are up and the cluster is set, we can use the CQL shell to create a table.

Run a CQL shell: 

`docker exec -it Node_X cqlsh`{{execute}}
