Finally, let's summarize what we learned in this lab.

## Summary

These are the main points we covered:

* ScyllaDB data modeling is query-based. We think of the application workflow and the queries early on in the data model process;
* You can use ScyllaDB to store chat messages based applications;
* If you need to count a value, you should use **counter** type;
* You can do batch inserts with any ScyllaDB Driver.

We hope that you liked this labs and don't forget to post about it in your socials!
